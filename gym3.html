              The gym has a great variety of machines, it has been renovated
              recently. There are plenty of choices for classes (including yoga,
              pilates, fitbox and many more). The gym is overall quite clean,
              including the changing rooms and showers.

              Kristy was a great support and help for me during my recovery from
              major surgeries and subsequent physical weakness and pain. Her
              sweet attitude was also a big comfort. I was totally impressed. "

              I love this place. I highly recommend this place to anyone who
              wants to get in shape. The trainers are really awesome and
              helpful, they make you feel really comfortable. The 45 min
              training goes super fast and you really enjoy doing it. Everyday
              is a new training, so it is never boring.
